<h2><strong><em>Description</em></strong></h2>
<p class="one">Egusi soup is a delicious and popular Nigerian dish made from ground melon seeds.
    These seeds are blended into a paste, which is then used to make a thick, hearty soup.
    The soup is typically cooked with a variety of ingredients like vegetables, meat, or fish,
