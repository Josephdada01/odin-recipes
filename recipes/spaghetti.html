    leaves brings a burst of freshness to the dish.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Boil Spaghetti: Cook spaghetti pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package 
        instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Sauté Garlic and Red Pepper (Optional): In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and 
        red pepper flakes (if using). Sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add Crushed Tomatoes or Sauce: Pour in crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce into the skillet. Stir and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken.
        If desired, add a splash of red wine for extra flavor.</li>
    <li>Season the Sauce: Season the sauce with salt, black pepper, and the Italian seasoning blend (or a mix of dried oregano, basil, and thyme). Adjust seasoning to taste. 
        If the sauce is too acidic, you can add a pinch of sugar to balance the flavors.</li>
    <li>Combine with Pasta: Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the sauce. 
        Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add Fresh Basil: Tear or chop fresh basil leaves and sprinkle them over the spaghetti. 
        Gently mix them into the dish.</li>
    <li>Serve: Plate the spaghetti, garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, and serve hot.</li>
